#include <stdio.h>  // Include the standard input-output library

// Define a structure named 'insa'
struct insa {
  char name[10];  // Character array to store the name (up to 9 characters + null terminator)
  int age;  // Integer to store the age
  struct insa* imp1_a;  // Pointer to another 'insa' structure
  struct insa* imp2_b;  // Pointer to another 'insa' structure
};

main() {
  // Define three instances of the 'insa' structure with initial values
  struct insa p1 = {"Kim", 28, NULL, NULL};  // Instance p1 with name "Kim" and age 28
  struct insa p2 = {"Lee", 36, NULL, NULL};  // Instance p2 with name "Lee" and age 36
  struct insa p3 = {"Park", 41, NULL, NULL};  // Instance p3 with name "Park" and age 41

  // Establish relationships between the instances
  p1.imp1_a = &p2;  // Set p1's imp1_a pointer to point to p2
  p2.imp2_b = &p3;  // Set p2's imp2_b pointer to point to p3

  // Print the name of the instance pointed to by p1's imp1_a pointer
  printf("%s\n", p1.imp1_a->name);  // Output: "Lee"

  // Print the age of the instance pointed to by p2's imp2_b pointer
  printf("%d\n", p2.imp2_b->age);  // Output: 41
}

// The program defines a structure named insa with two members: a character array to store the name and an integer to store the age. It then defines three instances of the insa structure: p1, p2, and p3, with corresponding names and ages. The program establishes relationships between the instances by setting pointers imp1_a and imp2_b to point to other instances. Finally, it prints the name of the instance pointed to by imp1_a and the age of the instance pointed to by imp2_b. However, there are several issues in the code:
// The printf statements should use the %s format specifier to print strings, not %d.
// output should be Lee
// 41
