// The program defines a function isPerfectNum that checks if a given number is a perfect number. A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors, excluding itself. The main function then iterates over the numbers from 1 to 1000 and calculates the sum of all perfect numbers found. The program prints the cumulative sum of perfect numbers to the console. The output is the sum of all perfect numbers between 1 and 1000. The program is correct and functional, displaying the expected output without errors or issues. The return 0; statement is not required in this case.
